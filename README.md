## **Project Overview** 📝  
This project focuses on analysing gym members' exercise and health data to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations. Using **Power BI**, we created an interactive and visually engaging dashboard that tracks key performance indicators (KPIs), demographics, and workout statistics.  

Key objectives of this project include:  
1. Analysing members' age distribution, workout types, and session durations.  
2. Tracking calories burned and water intake by demographic groups.  
3. Visualising health metrics like BMI and fat percentage for meaningful insights.  
4. Enabling stakeholders to make data-informed decisions through interactive visuals.
